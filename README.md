<h1>A Script to Create a Basic React Project</h1>
<h2>This uses <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/">Snowpack</a> as the bundler instead of Webpack</h2>

<p>This Bash script will create a basic project folder with correctly set up files in order to start 
developing in Reactjs.</p>

<p>This script does not install nodejs or npm.  Those things to run and develop Reactjs are required beforehand.</p>

<p>However, once tihs script works, you should be able to enter your project folder and type 'npm start' and the basic page should run</p>
